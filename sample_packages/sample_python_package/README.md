## Sample Python package

This package will simulate different scenarios to test package analysis on. While this package will attempt to revert any modifications it makes, it is not recommended to install, import, or use this package in any way outside of a sandboxed setting.

To use this package for local analysis, build this package by running
`python3 -m build` in this directory. The package will be located in the dist/
folder.

Developers can modify the parameters to the run_selected_functions calls. Note, however, that at this time package analysis does not output logs from all phases.

The same license for the rest of the package analysis project applies to this package.
